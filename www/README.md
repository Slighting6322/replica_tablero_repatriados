This folder holds static web assets used by the Shiny app (CSS, JS, images, components).

Note: the original `index.html` template was used earlier but the UI has been migrated to `ui.R` (reactive UI).
Keep fonts, CSS and web components here; do not remove `componentes/header.js` and `componentes/footer.js` if you rely on those web components.
